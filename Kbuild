# The blob was built for ARMv7-A / Thumb-2 / soft-float EABI with 8-byte
# alignment (readelf -A). Nothing here needs to match that for the *link*,
# but the final module does, so keep the kernel's own ARM flags.
# --- Broadcom shared sources ------------------------------------------
# The file list and flags are FreshTomato's, extracted by evaluating
# vendor/wl/config/{wlconfig_lx_shared,wl.mk} with make, plus the extra defines
# from drivers/net/hnd/Makefile in its kernel tree.
#
# Getting WLFLAGS exactly right is not cosmetic: Broadcom's own struct layouts
# (osl_t, si_t, ...) depend on these defines, so a different set would make
# this code disagree with the blob about its own structures.
# Single source of truth, shared with shadow/mkoffsets.sh - see shadow/wlflags
# for where each flag comes from. They were previously duplicated here and
# omitted from the offsets probe, which measured a struct sk_buff the blob
# never sees: CTF inserts fields immediately after ->cb, shifting everything
# after it.

# shadow/bcm-override must precede vendor/include: it interposes on
# <linux_osl.h> so the PKT* macros address the shadow sk_buff.
# Per-packet header-move recording, for chasing receive-path bugs. OFF by
# default and deliberately compile-time rather than runtime: the ring lives in
# every skb shadow, and carrying it pushes the allocation from the kmalloc-256
# slab into kmalloc-512 - doubling the per-packet footprint on both hot paths.
# A static_assert in wl_shadow_skb.h enforces that, so the cost cannot creep
# back in unnoticed.
#
#   make WL_SKB_OPS_TRACE=1

# Everything else (dma_trace, rx_trace) stays compiled in and is switched at
# runtime, because a global read and a branch cost nothing worth measuring.
